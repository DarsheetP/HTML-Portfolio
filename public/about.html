<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>My name is Darsheet Patel and I am a recent graduate from The College of New Jersey's School of Engineering.

  I am writing to express my interest in the software Engineering role.

<p>My resume demonstrates my commitment to excellence. However, even if it doesn't fully capture it, 
  I take great pride in being a first-generation student who successfully navigated to one of the top public 
  schools in the Northeast. While at The College of New Jersey, I have taken numerous mathematics, computer science, 
  and engineering classes, introducing me to the world of data and advancing my analytical skills. 
  The challenging path of engineering has provided me with valuable skills such as problem-solving and 
  a strong work ethic. Beyond completing my engineering degree, I seized every summer to gain practical 
  experience through internships, refining my abilities in a professional setting. I have also practiced 
  Python, SQL, and ETL through my employment at CobraVision LLC, a start-up company utilizing artificial 
  intelligence to create safer environments for engineers and construction workers. Additionally, working 
  with Northrop Grumman has given me experience with Excel, AutoCAD, MATLAB, data entry, and analysis. 
  I believe that with my previous work experience, I could adequately assist the software engineering team 
  to produce results that better serve the company.
